## ELASTICBEANSTALK_DEMO

**what is elastic beanstalk?**

   AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to deploy and manage applications quickly without 
worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Elastic Beanstalk handles the provisioning of resources, load balancing, scaling, monitoring, and deployment of the application. 


**Why Use elastic beanstalk?**

Simplified Deployment: Elastic Beanstalk abstracts away the infrastructure details, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

Auto Scaling: Automatically scales your application based on demand.

Support for Multiple Languages: Supports Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.

Integration with AWS Services: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like RDS, S3, and CloudWatch.

**When to Use Elastic Beanstalk:**

1. When you need to quickly deploy applications without managing infrastructure and also applications that require automatic scaling based on traffic and demand.

2. When you want AWS to handle the operational aspects of your application, including updates and patching.

  many more usecases are with elastic beanstalk like for maintaining different environments (dev and testing purposes) etc..
